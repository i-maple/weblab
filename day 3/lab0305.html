                aircraft, it soon acquired a third row of sears, stretching it to a sic-place plane.The 210 is classified as a high-preformance airplane,<br>
                which means its landing gear is retractable and its engine has more than 200 horsepower. In its first model year, which was 1960,<br>
                the 210 was powered by a 260-horsepower fuel-injected six-cylinder engine that displaced 471 cubic inches. The 210 is the fastest <br> 
                singel-engine airplane ever built by Cessna.
